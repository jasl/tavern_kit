# CharacterAsset fixtures for testing
# Note: These require active_storage_blobs to be available
# For most tests, assets are created dynamically
# This file is kept minimal to avoid fixture loading issues

# Fixtures will be created dynamically in tests that need them
# See CharacterAssetTest for examples
