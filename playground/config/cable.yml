# Use PostgreSQL adapter for cross-process broadcasting (SolidQueue jobs -> web server)
# This uses PostgreSQL's NOTIFY/LISTEN mechanism which is simpler and more compatible
# with actioncable-next than solid_cable's polling mechanism.
development:
  adapter: solid_cable
  connects_to:
    database:
      writing: cable
  polling_interval: 0.1.seconds
  message_retention: 1.day

test:
  adapter: test

production:
  adapter: solid_cable
  connects_to:
    database:
      writing: cable
  polling_interval: 0.1.seconds
